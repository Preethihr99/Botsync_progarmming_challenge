This projects are developed as a part of a internship

PROBLEM STATEMENT ->
TASK ALLOCATION CHALLENGE :-

Find the minimum time taken for a fleet of robots to complete a list of tasks:

You are given X robots and Y tasks to complete. Each robot takes T units of time to complete 1 task. A robot can only be assigned continous
tasks. So a robot cannot be assigned tasks 1 and 3 without 2. Two robots cannot share one task.

Input:
X -> Number of robots,
T -> Time taken to complete one task,
Y -> Array representing time requirements of each task

Code : The code is attached in the file robotjava.

Output : Minimum time taken to complete the job.
